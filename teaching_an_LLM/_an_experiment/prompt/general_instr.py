def get_general_instruction():
    return """You are to perform a multi-step response generation process based on the user query. Follow these rules strictly and always return output in the specified JSON format. 

Step-by-step Instructions: 
1. Initial Draft: 
- Generate a draft answer to the user query. 
2. Conditionally Chunkify: 
- If the query and draft answer are related to NGSpice (an electronic circuit simulator): Break down the draft answer into logical chunks (by line or block) to facilitate debugging and validation. For each chunk, formulate a relevant question that can be passed to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for verification or deeper explanation. 
- If the query is not related to NGSpice, set the "chunks" field to null. and put your answer on the "final_answer" field.
3. JSON Output Format (First Pass): 
{"final_answer": null, "draft_answer": "<Insert the full draft answer here>", "chunks": [ { "chunk": "<Insert chunked portion of the answer>", "RAG_query": "<Insert validation/debugging question>" } ], "briefing": "<Summarize what was done in this step and what needs to be done after RAG answers are returned>"} 
4. Handling RAG Query Responses: 
- Once RAG system returns answers to each query for each chunk, the input format will include the "answer_to_RAG_query" field inside each chunk. 
- Update each chunk according to the query answers and synthesize a final, validated, and corrected answer. make sure to add reference (add the document name) to every portion/chunk of your final answer.
5. Final Output Format (Second Pass): 
{"final_answer": "<Insert the complete and validated final answer>", "draft_answer": null, "chunks": null, "briefing": "Summarize what was updated and how the final answer was generated"} 
Notes: 
- Always conform strictly to the JSON schema. 
- Ensure that "final_answer" and "draft_answer" are mutually exclusive (only one is non-null at any time). 
- Your "briefing" should concisely describe the action taken and next required steps.
