### Summary: Analysis and Output Control (Batch Mode) in Ngspice

1. **Batch Mode Execution**:
   - Command to invoke batch mode:
     ```
     ngspice -b -r rawfile.raw circuitfile.cir
     ```
     or use file redirection:
     ```
     ngspice < circuitfile.cir
     ```
   - In batch mode:
     - `.ac`, `.tran`, or other analysis specified in the input file are executed automatically.
     - If `-r rawfile.raw` is used, simulation data is written to a rawfile, which can later be loaded in interactive mode:
       ```
       load
       ```
     - Internal device variables can be saved using `.save` (see Chapter 11.6, Appendix 27 for details).

2. **Output Control**:
   - If no rawfile is specified:
     - Results can be printed in "line-printer" format or tables using:
       - `.print`
       - `.plot`
       - `.four` (Fourier analysis)
   
3. **Interactive Mode Behavior**:
   - Command to start in interactive mode:
     ```
     ngspice circuitfile.cir
     ```
   - If no `.control ... .endc` section is provided, the dot commands inside the circuit file will not execute automatically. They require the `run` command to be issued manually.
