**Summarized Information:**

**Component: Coupled (Mutual) Inductors**

**General Form:**  
`KXXXXXXX LYYYYYYY LZZZZZZZ value`

- `LYYYYYYY` and `LZZZZZZZ` are the names of coupled inductors.  
- `value` is the coupling coefficient \( K \), where \( 0 < K \leq 1 \).  

**Key Notes:**  
- The `dot` convention for coupled inductors places a `dot` at the first node of each inductor.  
- Pairwise coupling is allowed for more than 2 inductors. 

**Example Code (Pairwise coupling):**  
```
L1 1 0  10u  
L2 2 0  11u  
L3 3 0  10u  
K12 L1 L2 0.99  
K23 L2 L3 0.99  
K13 L1 L3 0.98  
```
> Note: Physically impossible coupling combinations are flagged by `ngspice`.

**Coupling of More than Two Inductors in a Single Statement:**  
- All coupling constants are equal.
  
**Example Code (Multi-inductor statement):**  
```
L1 1 0  10u  
L2 2 0  11u  
L3 3 0  10u  
K123 L1 L2 L3 0.97  
```

**Theoretical Characteristics:**
- Coupling coefficient \( K \) should satisfy \( 0 < K \leq 1 \).  
- Proper coupling constants must conserve energy; non-physical configurations are flagged by `ngspice`.
