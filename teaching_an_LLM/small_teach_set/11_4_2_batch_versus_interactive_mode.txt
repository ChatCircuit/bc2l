- **Batch Mode and Interactive Mode Differences**:
  - `.meas` commands *cannot be used in batch mode* (`-b` flag) if an output (.raw) file is also specified with the `-r` flag, as the simulation output is written directly to the output file and isn't kept in memory for further analysis.
  - To execute `.meas` during batch-like operations, include a `.control ... .endc` section in the input file and run ngspice in *interactive mode* (e.g., `ngspice inputfile`).

- **Interactive Mode Setup Example**:
  ```
  *input file
  ...
  .tran 1ns 1000ns
  ...
  *********************************
  .control
  run
  write outputfile data
  .endc
  *********************************
  .end
  ```

- **Capabilities of `.meas`**:
  - Outputs user-defined analysis data directly to the standard output.
  - Includes calculations of delay, rise time, fall time, peak-to-peak voltage, min/max voltage, integral/derivative over a specific period, and other user-defined values.
