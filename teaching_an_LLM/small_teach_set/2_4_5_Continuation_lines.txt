**Summary:**

**Continuation Lines in Ngspice:**

- **General Syntax:**  
    `<any command>`  
    `+ <continuation of any command> ; some comment`  
    `+ <further continuation of any command>`  

- **Purpose:**  
If command lines are overly long, they can be split for better readability. Internally, they will merge into a single line. 

- **Continuation Line Rules:**  
    - Each continuation line must begin with a `+` followed by a space.  
    - Continuation lines must immediately follow the previous line.  
    - **Alternative Method:** Lines can also be continued by ending with two backslashes (`\\`), similar to Unix shell syntax.  

- **Exclusions:**  
Continuation lines cannot be used with `.title`, `.lib`, and `.include` commands.
