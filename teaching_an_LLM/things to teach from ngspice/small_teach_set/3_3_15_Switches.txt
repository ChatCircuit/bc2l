**Summary for Netlist Code Use, Debugging, and Queries:**

**Switches Overview:**
- Two types:  
  1. **Voltage-controlled switch**: "SXXXXXXX" (model: SW).  
  2. **Current-controlled switch**: "WXXXXXXX" (model: CSW).  

- Key characteristics:
  - **Hysteresis** can be defined (ON or OFF state based on controlling signal range).
  - **Resistance**: On-resistance (`R_on`) and off-resistance (`R_off`) must satisfy \(0 < R < \infty\).

**General Syntax:**
1. **Voltage-controlled switch**:  
   `SXXXXXXX N+ N- NC+ NC- MODEL <ON><OFF>`  
   - `N+`, `N-`: Termination nodes.  
   - `NC+`, `NC-`: Positive and negative nodes for controlling voltage signal.  
   - `MODEL`: Mandatory model for the switch.  
   - `<ON>/<OFF>` (optional): Initial state when control signal is in hysteresis range.

2. **Current-controlled switch**:  
   `WYYYYYYY N+ N- VNAM MODEL <ON><OFF>`  
   - `N+`, `N-`: Termination nodes.  
   - `VNAM`: Voltage source controlling the current through it.  
   - `MODEL`: Mandatory model for the switch.  
   - `<ON>/<OFF>` (optional): Initial state when control current is in hysteresis range.

**Key Details:**
- Voltage-controlled switches:
  - Control depends on the voltage between `NC+` and `NC-`.
- Current-controlled switches:
  - Control depends on the current flowing through the specified voltage source (`VNAM`).
  - Positive current flows from the positive terminal, through the source, to the negative terminal.

**Examples:**
1. **Voltage-controlled:**
   ```
   s1 1 2 3 4 switch1 ON
   s2 5 6 3 0 sm2 OFF
   ```

2. **Current-controlled:**
   ```
   w1 1 2 vclock switchmod1
   W2 3 0 vramp sm1 ON
   wreset 5 6 vclck lossyswitch OFF
   ```

- **Initial Conditions (`<ON>/<OFF>`):**  
  Necessary if control voltage/current starts within the hysteresis range (determines the initial state of the switch).
