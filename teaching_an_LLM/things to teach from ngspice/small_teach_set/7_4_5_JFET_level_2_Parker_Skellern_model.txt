**Ngspice JFET Level 2 Parker Skellern Model (7.4.5 Summary)**

1. **Key Characteristics of the Model**:
   - Improvements over Level 1 JFET model with smooth high-order derivatives, crucial for distortion and intermodulation predictions.
   - Frequency-dependent output conductance and transconductance as bias functions.
   - Accurate pinch-off potential modulation by both drain-gate and source-gate potentials, matching S-parameter and pulsed-bias measurements.
   - Self-heating varies with frequency.
   - Includes all extreme operating regions (subthreshold, forward gate bias, controlled resistance, breakdown).
   - Independent fitting parameters for different operating regions, preventing compromises.
   - Strict drain-source symmetry with smooth transitions during drain-source potential reversal.
