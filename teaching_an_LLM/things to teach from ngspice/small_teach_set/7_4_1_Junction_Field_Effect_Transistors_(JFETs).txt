**Summary for Netlist Code Generation/Modification/Debugging**

**Component: Junction Field-Effect Transistors (JFETs)**

- **General Form**:  
  `JXXXXXXX nd ng ns mname <area> <off> <ic=vds,vgs> <temp=t>`

- **Definitions**:  
  - `nd, ng, ns`: Drain, gate, and source nodes, respectively.  
  - `mname`: Model name for the JFET.  
  - `<area>` (optional): Area factor, defaults to `1.0` if omitted.  
  - `<off>` (optional): Initial condition indicator for DC analysis.  
  - `<ic=vds,vgs>` (optional): Initial conditions for drain-source voltage (VDS) and gate-source voltage (VGS). Used with `.TRAN` and the `uic` option for transient analysis.  
  - `<temp=t>` (optional): Device operating temperature, overrides `.option` temperature setting.

- **Notes**:  
  - Using `.ic` control line is a better approach for setting initial conditions.  
  - The `uic` option is required when `ic=vds,vgs` is used during transient analysis.

**Example**:  
`J1 7 2 3 JM1 OFF`  
Explanation: This sets up a JFET with drain at node 7, gate at node 2, source at node 3, using the model `JM1`, and sets it to an "OFF" initial condition.
