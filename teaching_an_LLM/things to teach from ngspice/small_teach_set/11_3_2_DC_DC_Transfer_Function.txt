.dc command in Ngspice is used to define a **DC transfer curve** sweep of sources, resistors, or circuit temperature under DC conditions (capacitors open, inductors shorted).

### General Syntax:
```
.dc srcnam vstart vstop vincr [src2 vstart2 vstop2 vincr2]
```

### Parameters:
- **srcnam**: Name of a voltage/current source, resistor, or temperature being swept.
- **vstart, vstop, vincr**: Start value, stop value, and increment step for the sweep.
- **src2, vstart2, vstop2, vincr2**: (Optional) A second independent variable for a nested sweep.

### Functionality:
- Sweeps the primary source (`srcnam`) over the specified range.
- If a second sweep source (`src2`) is provided, the second variable sweeps over its range and, for each of its values, the primary source is fully swept.

#### Use Case:
- Provides characteristics such as device output curves or circuit performance under varying parameters.

### Examples:
1. **Single Sweep**:
   ```
   .dc VIN 0.25 5.0 0.25
   ```
   Sweeps voltage source `VIN` from 0.25 V to 5.0 V in steps of 0.25 V.

2. **Nested Sweep**:
   ```
   .dc VDS 0 10 .5 VGS 0 5 1
   ```
   Sweeps `VDS` from 0 to 10 V in steps of 0.5 V, with `VGS` nested: sweeping from 0 to 5 V in steps of 1 V.

3. **Resistor Sweep**:
   ```
   .dc RLoad 1k 2k 100
   ```
   Sweeps resistor `RLoad` from 1 kΩ to 2 kΩ in steps of 100 Ω.

4. **Temperature Sweep**:
   ```
   .dc TEMP -15 75 5
   ```
   Sweeps circuit temperature from -15 °C to 75 °C in steps of 5 °C.

### Characteristics:
- **Independent source control** allows precise testing across a range of configurations.
- **Nested sweeps** facilitate device characterization (e.g., transistor output curves).
