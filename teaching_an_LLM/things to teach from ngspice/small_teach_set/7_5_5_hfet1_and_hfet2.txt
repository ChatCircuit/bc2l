**Summary:**  
**hfet1 (Level 5)**  
- Component: Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor (HFET).  
- Model source: "Semiconductor Device Modeling for VLSI" (K. Lee et al., Prentice Hall, 1993).  
- Relevant details in AIM-Spice reference manual, section Device Models A (covers model parameters, equivalent circuit diagrams, and device equations).  

**hfet2 (Level 6)**  
- Simplified version of hfet1 (Level 5).  
- Optimized for speed and suited for digital circuit simulation.  
- Certain features of level 1 (hfet1) model are omitted to enhance simulation speed.
