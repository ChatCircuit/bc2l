2.10.2 Brace Expressions in Circuit Elements:

- General Form: `{ <expr> }`
- Usage: Allowed in `.model` lines and device lines.
- Limitations: 
  1. Brace expressions cannot parameterize node names or parts of names.
  2. All identifiers inside `<expr>` must have known values during evaluation; otherwise, an error occurs.
- SPICE Numbers: Float with optional scaling suffix (details in Chapter 2.10.5).
