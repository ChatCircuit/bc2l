**HICUM Level 2 Model Summary for Ngspice:**

1. **Model Overview:**
   - **Model:** Physics-based HIgh-CUrrent Model (HICUM) Level 2 (L2)
   - **Purpose:** Standard compact model for bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs)
   - **Supported Technologies:** SiGe HBTs, InP HBTs
   - **Supported Effects:**
     - Substrate transistor
     - Avalanche effects
     - Physics-based transfer current model
     - Self-heating
     - Accurate temperature dependence
     - Excess phase between base and collector current
   - **Not Implemented:** Noise correlation network
   - **Ngspice Version:** HICUML2/2.4
   - **Activation:** `level=8` in `.model` statement

2. **Node Connections:**
   - Exposed model nodes: `C` (Collector), `B` (Base), `E` (Emitter), `S` (Substrate), `T` (Temperature)
   - User modifications:
     - Thermal and substrate network customization via `T` and `S` node connections
   - Note: Extreme operating regions may cause convergence issues (self-heating, avalanche effect).

3. **HICUM/L2 Initiation Syntax:**
   ```
   .model mod1 npn Level=8
   Qx collector base emitter substrate model area=value
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   vc c 0 0
   vb b 0 1
   ve e 0 0
   vs s 0 0
   Q1 c b e s dt mod1 area=1
   .model mod1 npn Level=8
   ```

4. **Self-heating Parameters:**
   - **Model Parameter:** `FLSH`
     - `FLSH=1`: Main thermal contributions of IC and IB
     - `FLSH=2`: Includes all transistor power dissipations
   - **Thermal Resistance Parameter:** `RTH`
   - Note: Self-heating requires `T` node connection in the circuit.
