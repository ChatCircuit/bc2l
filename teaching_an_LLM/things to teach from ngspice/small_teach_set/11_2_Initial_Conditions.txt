### Summary: Ngspice Manual (Section 11.2 Initial Conditions)

#### Initial Condition Specification:
- **Purpose**: Used to set the initial voltages on capacitors and currents through inductors in the circuit. Essential for determining circuit behavior at the start of simulations, especially transient analysis. 

#### Command Syntax:
- Defined in netlists using **`.IC`** in the following format:
  ```
  .IC V(node1)=value1 V(node2)=value2 ...
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  .IC V(1)=2.5 V(2)=0.5
  ```
  - Sets the initial voltage at node 1 to 2.5V and node 2 to 0.5V.

#### Impact and Behavior:
- **Transient Analysis (default)**: 
  - Overrides default initial guesses for circuit variables.
  - Typically influences the initial solution of differential equations.
- **DC Operating Point**: 
  - Does NOT modify the DC operating point directly unless `.NODESET` or another related directive is used.

#### Related Notes:
- The `.IC` directive is used during transient analysis and enhances the solver's performance by providing a good starting point.
