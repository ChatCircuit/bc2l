### Extracted Summary for .LIB Command in Ngspice  

**General Form:**  
`.LIB filename libname`  

**Example:**  
`.LIB /users/spice/common/mosfets.lib mos1`  

**Purpose:**  
The `.LIB` command is used to include library descriptions into the input netlist.  

**Details:**  
- Inside the referenced `.lib` file, a specific library section (`libname`) is selected.  
- Statements for each library are enclosed using `.LIB libname ... .ENDL`.  
- The file search behavior for `.LIB` is the same as for `.include`.  

**Compatibility Mode Syntax:**  
- Setting compatibility mode to `ps` (`set ngbehavior=ps`) allows the simplified syntax:  
  `.LIB filename`  
- In this case, the `filename` is directly included, issuing only a warning.
