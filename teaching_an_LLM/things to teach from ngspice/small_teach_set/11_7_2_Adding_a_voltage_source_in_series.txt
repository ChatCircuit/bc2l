**Summary:**

1. **Purpose of Adding a Voltage Source in Series:**
   - The ngspice matrix solver calculates node voltages and currents through independent voltage sources.
   - A voltage source with `dc voltage 0` can be added in series to measure the current through a resistor.

2. **Current Measurement Technique Using Voltage Source in Series:**
   ```ngspice
   * Original Circuit
   V1 1 0 1
   R1 1 0 5
   R2 1 0 10

   * Modified Circuit with Current Measurement
   V1 1 0 1
   R1 1 11 5
   Vmeas 11 0 dc 0
   R2 1 0 10
   ```
   - `Vmeas 11 0 dc 0` is added in series with `R1`.
   - Current is accessible as `vmeas#branch` after simulation.

3. **Key Notes for Current Measurement:**
   - Voltage source added in series should have `dc voltage 0` to avoid altering the circuit behavior.
   - Access current calculation through `vmeas#branch`.
