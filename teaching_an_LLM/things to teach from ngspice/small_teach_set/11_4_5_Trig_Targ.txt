### Summary of Section 11.4.5 from Ngspice Manual:
#### .MEASURE Command
- **Purpose:** Measures differences in DC voltage, frequency, or time between two points selected from one or two output vectors. It is applicable to transient (`TRAN`), AC (`AC`), spectrum (`SP`), or DC analyses.

#### General Syntax:
```
.MEASURE {DC|AC|TRAN|SP} result TRIG trig_variable VAL=val
+ <TD=td> <CROSS=# | CROSS=LAST> <RISE=# | RISE=LAST>
+ <FALL=# | FALL=LAST> <TRIG AT=time> TARG targ_variable
+ VAL=val <TD=td> <CROSS=# | CROSS=LAST> <RISE=# | RISE=LAST>
+ <FALL=# | FALL=LAST> <TARG AT=time>
```
- **Parameters:**
  - `result`: Name assigned to the measurement result.
  - `TRIG`: Specifies the trigger condition (variable, value, rise, fall, cross, or fixed time point).
  - `TARG`: Specifies the target condition (similar options as `TRIG`).
  - `<TD=td>`: Optional delay time for analysis start.
  - `<RISE=#>`: Specifies the rising slope occurrence.
  - `<FALL=#>`: Specifies the falling slope occurrence.
  - `<CROSS=#>`: Specifies the crossing occurrence on any slope.
  - `<TRIG AT=time>`: Fixed trigger time point.
  - `<TARG AT=time>`: Fixed target time point.

#### Example Codes:
1. **Measure Signal Period:**
   ```
   .measure tran tdiff TRIG v(1) VAL=0.5 RISE=1 TARG v(1) VAL=0.5 RISE=2
   ```
   - Measures time between the first rising slope and the second rising slope of `v(1)` crossing `0.5 V`.

   **Output:** 
   ```
   tdiff = 1.000000e-003 targ= 1.083343e-003 trig= 8.334295e-005
   ```

2. **Measure Two Periods:**
   ```
   .measure tran tdiff TRIG v(1) VAL=0.5 RISE=1 TARG v(1) VAL=0.5 RISE=3
   ```
   - Measures time between the first rising slope and the third rising slope of `v(1)` crossing `0.5 V`.

3. **Measure Rising to Falling Slope:**
   ```
   .measure tran tdiff TRIG v(1) VAL=0.5 RISE=1 TARG v(1) VAL=0.5 FALL=1
   ```
   - Measures time between the first rising slope and the first falling slope of `v(1)` crossing `0.5 V`.

4. **Measure Trigger vs Target on Different Nodes:**
   ```
   .measure tran tdiff TRIG v(1) VAL=0 FALL=3 TARG v(2) VAL=0 FALL=3
   ```
   - Time difference between the third falling slope of `v(1)` reaching `0 V` and the third falling slope of `v(2)` reaching `0 V`.

5. **Crossing Slopes:**
   ```
   .measure tran tdiff TRIG v(1) VAL=-0.6 CROSS=1 TARG v(2) VAL=-0.8 CROSS=1
   ```
   - Time difference between the first crossing of `v(1)` at `-0.6 V` and `v(2)` at `-0.8 V` (any slope).

6. **Trigger at Fixed Time Point:**
   ```
   .measure tran tdiff TRIG AT=1m TARG v(2) VAL=-0.8 CROSS=3
   ```
   - Time difference between `1 ms` and the third crossing of `v(2)` at `-0.8 V` (any slope).

#### Notes:
- **Default Values:** Not explicitly stated; behavior depends on the syntax (e.g., first occurrence for `RISE`, `FALL`, or `CROSS` if unspecified).
- **Use Cases:** Debugging netlists, analyzing transient behavior, and extracting signal timing characteristics in simulations.
