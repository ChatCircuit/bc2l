**Summary of VBIC Model Section (Ngspice Manual 7.3.4)**  

**VBIC Model Overview**  
- Development of the VBIC model is an improvement to the Standard Gummel-Poon (SGP) model, specifically for modern semiconductor technologies and integrated bipolar transistors.  
- Includes a modified Quasi-Saturation model for modeling discrete switching and RF transistor characteristics.  
- Supports silicon, SiGe, and III-V HBT devices.  

**Key Features of VBIC Model:**  
- **Integrated substrate transistor:** Models parasitic devices in integrated processes.  
- **Improved modeling:** Early effect, depletion capacitance, base-emitter breakdown, weak avalanche effects, and temperature modeling.  
- **Physical separation of Ic and Ib.**  
- **Self-heating modeling:** Includes a simple 1-pole thermal network to account for power dissipation effects.   

**Self-Heating Modeling Details:**  
- A node `dt` is used for thermal modeling with a parallel resistor (RTH) and capacitor (Cth) network to ground. The voltage at `dt` corresponds to the BJT junction temperature.  
- Thermal effects (resistor/current/capacitor changes) are computed using temperature update equations integrated into the Ngspice analytical iteration schema.  
- Controlled by the `SELFT` parameter:  
  - `SELFT=0`: Self-heating off (default).  
  - `SELFT=1`: Self-heating on.  
- `RTH` must be specified for self-heating.  

**Minimal VBIC Instantiation with Self-Heating**  
```spice

```

**Advanced Thermal Network Example**  
- Demonstrates the integration of a custom thermal network between node `dt` and environment:  
```spice
