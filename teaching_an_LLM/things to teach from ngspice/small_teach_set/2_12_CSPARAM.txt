### Summary for `.CSPARAM` (Ngspice Manual - Section 2.12)

#### Purpose:
The `.CSPARAM` command helps create constant vectors from parameters in the `plot const`. These vectors:
- Are of length one.
- Have real values.
- Are generated during circuit parsing and cannot be modified later.

#### General Syntax:
`.csparam <ident> = <expr>`

#### Key Notes:
- `.csparam` vectors can be used in Ngspice scripts and `.control` sections.
- Functionality of `.csparam` is experimental and requires testing.
- Vectors defined via `.csparam` are added to the list of constants available in `plot const`.

#### Examples:
1. **Parameter Creation:**
   ```
   .param pippo = 5
   .param pp = 6
   .csparam pippp = {pippo + pp}   ; Creates vector pippp with value 11
   ```

2. **String Expression:**
   ```
   .csparam pap = 'pp + p'         ; Expression as a string
   ```

3. **Usage in Scripts:**
   ```
   * test csparam
   .param TEMPS = 27
   .csparam newt = {3 * TEMPS}     ; Creates vector newt with value 81
   .csparam mytemp = '2 + TEMPS'   ; Evaluates as a string
   .control
   echo $&newt $&mytemp            ; Outputs constant values during simulation
   .endc
   .end
   ```

This syntax allows flexible vector creation based on parameters and supports its use in control sections, but due to its experimental nature, users must validate its results carefully.
