4.2 Linear Dependent Sources in Ngspice:

Ngspice supports four types of linear dependent sources, defined by these equations:
- `i = g*v` (transconductance, g)
- `v = e*v` (voltage gain, e)
- `i = f*i` (current gain, f)
- `v = h*i` (transresistance, h)

Constants `g`, `e`, `f`, and `h` represent the respective characteristics of each source.
