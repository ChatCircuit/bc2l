**Summary of Ngspice Manual Section 3.2.4: Initial Conditions**

1. **Device Initial Conditions for DC Convergence:**
   - **Purpose:** Enhances DC convergence in circuits with multiple stable states.
   - **Usage:**
     - Specify a device as `OFF` to set terminal voltages of the device to zero initially.
     - After convergence, Ngspice iterates to compute the exact terminal voltages.
     - `OFF` can be used to enforce convergence to a desired DC state.
     - If the device is truly conducting (despite being defined `OFF`), correct solutions are still computed, though more iterations may be required.

2. **Alternative DC Convergence Aid:**
   - **.NODESET:** Control line serving a similar purpose to `OFF`. Described in Chapter 11.2.1.
   - **Preferred Method:** `.NODESET` is easier to apply and should generally be used instead of `OFF`.

3. **Initial Conditions for Transient Analysis:**
   - True initial conditions for transient analysis, distinct from DC convergence aids.
   - Refer to `.IC` and `.TRAN` control lines for transient analysis initial condition details:
     - `.IC` Control Line (Chapter 11.2.2).
     - `.TRAN` Control Line (Chapter 11.3.10).
