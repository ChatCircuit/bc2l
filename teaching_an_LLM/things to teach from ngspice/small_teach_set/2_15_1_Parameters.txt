Parameters and functions in Ngspice (`.param` and `.func`) are evaluated before any simulation beginsâ€”during the setup of the circuit. As a result:

- **Simulation data (voltage/current vectors)** cannot be used within `.param` or `.func` because they are not yet available during evaluation.
- **Replacement and Evaluation:** During circuit setup, parameters and functions are computed, and resulting numerical values are substituted in the netlist.
- **Immutability:** Once parameters are evaluated, they cannot be modified based on feedback during or after the simulation process.
