11.7.2 Adding a voltage source in series
The ngspice matrix solver determines node voltages and currents through independent voltage sources. So to measure the currents through a resistor, you may add a voltage source in series with dc voltage 0.
Current measurement with series voltage source
*measure current through R1
V1 1 0 1
R1 1 0 5
R2 1 0 10
* will become
V1 1 0 1
R1 1 11 5
Vmeas 11 0 dc 0
R2 1 0 10
and the current is available as
vmeas#branch
after simulation.
