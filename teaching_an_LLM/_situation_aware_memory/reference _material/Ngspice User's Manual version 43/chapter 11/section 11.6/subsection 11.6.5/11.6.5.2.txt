11.6.5.2 (Differential) voltage measurement
Differential voltage measurements are achieved by placing a voltage controlled voltage source (VCVS, E device) with its two inputs connected to the nodes specified by the user and gain 1. The output is then saved in a vector with a leading vd_ in its name.
General form for (differential) voltage measurements:
.probe v(node1)
.probe vd(device:node1:node2)
.probe vd(device1:node1, device2:node2)
device, device1, and device2 are device names (first token in an instance line). node1, node2 are either numbers (according to the node sequence in the instance line, e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...), or are node names of known devices (d, g, s, b for MOS of JFET, c, b, e for bipolar.
Examples:
* voltage at node named nR1
.probe v(nR1)

* voltage across a two-terminal device named R1 
.probe vd(R1)

* voltage at instance node 1 of device m4
.probe vd(m4:1:0)

* voltage between nodes 1 and 3 of device m4
.probe vd(m4:1:3)

* voltage between node 1 of device m4 and node 3 of device m5
.probe vd(m4:1, m5:3)

* m4, m5 are MOS devices, so the following is equivalent:
.probe vd(m4:d, m5:s)
Resulting output vectors:
nR1
vd_R1
vd_m4:d:0
vd_m4:d:s
vd_m3:d_m5:s
