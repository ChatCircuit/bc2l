general,show your netlist,,yes,
"netlist mod, plot","plot the transient voltage across the capacitor, with R1=300ohm and R2=700ohm",,no,"did not add uic in netlist, hence plot not satisfactory, although no error, telling uic in prompt solves the issue."
"netlist mod, plot",incrase R1 resistance even more,,yes,
"netlist mod, plot",plot that for a 20ms,,yes,
"complex sim com, plot","plot the power consumed by the elements R1, R2 and the capacitor",,no,"almost okay, need some refinement just"
