- **Component/Feature:** KSPICE Lossy Transmission Lines in ngspice.  
- **Simulation Method:** Uses the recursive convolution method for simulating lossy transmission lines and coupled multiconductor line systems.  
  - Recursive convolution is derived from the Pade approximations of the function.  
  - This method results in faster simulations compared to the state-based approach in SPICE3.  

- **Theoretical Characteristics:**  
  - Simulates arbitrary transfer function impulse responses.  
  - Handles both transmission line characteristics and multiconductor line modal functions.  
    
- **Limitations:**  
  - Supports **only transient simulations**, no AC simulation capability.

- **Additional Notes:**  
  - The method is particularly relevant for faster transient analysis of lossy or coupled transmission lines but does not provide examples or netlist templates in the provided text.
