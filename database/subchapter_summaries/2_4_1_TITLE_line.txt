.TITLE Directive Summary:

- **Purpose**: Specifies the title or heading for the simulation output. 
- **Usage**: The title line must be the first line of the netlist file or explicitly specified using a `.TITLE` statement.
- **Syntax**:  
  `.TITLE <any title>`  

- **Behavior**:  
  - When `.TITLE` is used, it overrides the contents of the first line of the input deck and replaces it with the new title.  
  - The title is printed verbatim as the heading in the output sections.  

- **Examples**:
  ```
  .TITLE Test of CAM cell
  ```
  The above will replace the first line of the input deck with "Test of CAM cell" in both internal processing and simulation output.
