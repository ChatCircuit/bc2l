**Summary: AC Small-Signal Analysis for Netlist Code Generation and Queries**

- **Purpose**: AC analysis computes the sinusoidal steady-state behavior of analog circuits at a set of user-defined frequencies. It represents the small-signal response of the system.

- **Procedure**:
  1. **DC Operating Point**: Computes the circuit's DC operating point first.
  2. **Linearization**: Linearizes all nonlinear devices to create small-signal models.
  3. **Frequency Sweep**: Analyzes the linear circuit across a range of user-specified frequencies.

- **Outputs**:
  - Common outputs include transfer functions like voltage gain, transimpedance, etc.
  - For circuits with a single AC input, the input is often set to **unity magnitude and zero phase**, simplifying output variables to represent the transfer function directly.

**Note**: No code or specific syntax was provided in the excerpt. The primary takeaways involve theoretical understanding and typical setup practices for AC analysis in Ngspice.
