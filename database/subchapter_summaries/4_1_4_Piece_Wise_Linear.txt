**Summary:**

**Piece-Wise Linear (PWL):**

**General Form:**  
`PWL(T1 V1 <T2 V2 T3 V3 ...>) <r=value> <td=value>`

- Represents voltage or current source values at specific time points, `(T, V)`, using linear interpolation for intermediate times.  

**Parameters:**  
- `(T, V)`: Specifies the value (`V` in Volts or Amps) of the source at the given time (`T`).  
- `r`: Determines repeat behavior.  
  - `r = -1` or not provided: Sequence runs once, output remains at final value.  
  - `r = 0`: Entire sequence from time `0` to `Tn` repeats indefinitely.  
  - `r > 0`: Sequence between `r` and `Tn` repeats indefinitely. `r` must be one of the time points in the PWL sequence.  
- `td`: Delays the entire sequence by the specified time.  
- **Note:** `r` and `td` are only available with voltage sources, **not with current sources.**  

**Example Code:**  
```
VCLOCK 7 5 PWL(0 -7 10NS -7 11NS -3 17NS -3 18NS -7 50NS -7)
+ r=0 td=15NS
```

- This defines a voltage source (`VCLOCK`) with time-value pairs `(T, V)` using a PWL pattern.  
- Sequence starts at `0` and repeats indefinitely (`r=0`), with a delay of `15ns` (`td=15NS`).  

**Behavior:**  
- Linear interpolation is used for intermediate values of time.  
- Source will output specific values at defined times `(T, V)` and repeat or delay as specified by `r` and `td`.
