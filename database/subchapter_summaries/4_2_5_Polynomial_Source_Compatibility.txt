**Summary of the provided text:**

**Dependent Polynomial Sources in Ngspice (SPICE2G6 Compatibility):**  
- Ngspice supports dependent polynomial sources using the XSPICE extension. Instances are defined as specified in the following forms.

**Instance Card Syntax for Polynomial Sources:**  
1. **POLYNOMIAL VCVS (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source):**  
   `EXXXXXXX N+ N- POLY(ND) NC1+ NC1- P0 (P1...)`

2. **POLYNOMIAL VCCS (Voltage-Controlled Current Source):**  
   `GXXXXXXX N+ N- POLY(ND) NC1+ NC1- P0 (P1...)`

3. **POLYNOMIAL CCCS (Current-Controlled Current Source):**  
   `FXXXXXXX N+ N- POLY(ND) VNAM1 !VNAM2...? P0 (P1...)`

4. **POLYNOMIAL CCVS (Current-Controlled Voltage Source):**  
   `HXXXXXXX N+ N- POLY(ND) VNAM1 !VNAM2...? P0 (P1...)`

**Key Notes:**  
- Polynomial sources are used for complex dependency representation.
- Syntax: POLY(ND) signifies a polynomial dependency with ND terms.
- Parameters `P0, P1...` define polynomial coefficients starting with constant term `P0`.
