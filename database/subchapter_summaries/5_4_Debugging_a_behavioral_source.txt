- **Behavioral Sources and Debugging Context**: B, E, G sources and behavioral R, C, L elements are powerful but challenging to debug when defining user models. Issues become complex with multiple equations or repeated behavioral functions like `log()`.

- **Buggy Example Netlist**:
  ```
  V1 1 0 1
  V2 2 0 -2
  E41 4 0 vol = 'V(1)*log(V(2))'
  .control
  tran 1 1
  .endc
  .end
  ```
  - The above produces an error due to the invalid operation `log(-2)`:
    `Error: -2 out of range for log`.

- **Debugging with `ngdebug`**: 
  - If the **`ngdebug`** variable is set (e.g., in `.spiceinit`), it provides enhanced error messages with detailed information on variable values and operations. 
  - Resulting error breakdown:
    ```
    Error: -2 out of range for log
    calling PTeval, tree =
        (v0) * (log (v1))
    d / d v0 : log (v1)
    d / d v1 : (v0) * ((0.434294) / (v1))
    values: var0 = 1
            var1 = -2
    ```
  - This enables more precise debugging by revealing the parameter causing the issue.

- **Effect of `strict_errorhandling`**: 
  - If `strict_errorhandling` is enabled, Ngspice will immediately exit after the error.
  - If not enabled, debugging processes like **gmin** and **source stepping** may start, although these often fail in cases like this.
