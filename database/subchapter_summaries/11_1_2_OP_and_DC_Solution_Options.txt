**Summary of DC and OP (Operating Point) Solution Options**  

**Options for .DC and .OP Solution Settings**
- **ABSTOL=x:** Sets the absolute current error tolerance. Default = 1 pA.
- **GMIN=x:** Sets the minimum conductance. Default = 1.0e-12.
- **GMINSTEPS=x [*]:** Defines the number of Gmin stepping attempts. Default behavior: Gmin stepping is performed before source stepping unless `GMINSTEPS=0`.
- **ITL1=x:** Sets the DC iteration limit. Default = 100.
- **ITL2=x:** Sets the DC transfer curve iteration limit. Default = 50.
- **KEEPOPINFO:** Preserves the operating point (OP) information when running AC, Distortion, or Pole-Zero analysis. Avoids redundant `.OP` runs in large circuits.
- **NOOPITER:** Skips the first iteration and directly applies Gmin stepping.
- **PIVREL=x:** Sets the relative pivot threshold for numerical pivoting in the matrix. Default = 1.0e-3.
- **PIVTOL=x:** Sets the absolute minimum matrix entry for pivot acceptance. Default = 1.0e-13.
- **RELTOL=x:** Sets the relative error tolerance. Default = 0.001 (0.1%).
- **RSHUNT=x:** Activates resistors from each analog node to ground (XSPICE must be enabled). Resistor values should be high (e.g., 1.0e12 Ω) to avoid interfering with the circuit operation.
- **VNTOL=x:** Sets the absolute voltage error tolerance. Default = 1 μV.

**Matrix Conditioning in Circuit Simulation**
- Nodes without a DC path to ground (e.g., two capacitors in series or cascaded code models) can lead to simulation failures due to matrix singularity.
- To address this, use `RSHUNT`:
  ```
  .option rshunt = 1.0e12
  ```
  - Typical value = 1 TΩ. In severe cases, reduce to 10 GΩ or 1 GΩ.
- For inductors in parallel with voltage sources (causing AC analysis failures), add a small series resistor:
  ```
  .option rseries = 1.0e-4
  ```
  - Be cautious when using behavioral inductors, as results may become unpredictable.
- To stabilize matrices, add a small capacitor to each voltage node in the circuit:
  ```
  .option cshunt = 1.3e-13
  ```
