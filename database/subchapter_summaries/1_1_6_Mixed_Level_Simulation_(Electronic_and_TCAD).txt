### Summary of Ngspice Section 1.1.6 on Mixed-Level Simulation (Electronic and TCAD):

1. **Mixed-Level Simulation in Ngspice**:
   - Ngspice integrates with **CIDER**, which combines circuit simulation with device-level numerical modeling.
   - Compact models are used for noncritical devices, while critical devices are modeled numerically for added accuracy.

2. **CIDER Features**:
   - Couples Ngspice with an internal **C-based device simulator**.
   - Provides both **1D and 2D numerical device models** solving:
     - Poisson's equation.
     - Electron and hole current-continuity equations.
   - Input Format:
     - **SPICE-like** descriptions for circuits and compact models.
     - **PISCES-like** descriptions for numerically modeled device structures.
   - Includes physical models for **state-of-the-art technologies**, such as:
     - **Transverse field mobility degradation** for scaled-down MOSFETs.
     - **Polysilicon model** for poly-emitter BJTs.
   - **Temperature dependence** across -50°C to 150°C for most physical models.
   - Simulates basic semiconductor devices:
     - Resistors, MOS capacitors, diodes, BJTs, JFETs, MOSFETs.
     - BJTs and JFETs have optional substrate contacts.
   - Enables management of device **internal states**.
     - States can be preloaded for accurate initial conditions in subsequent simulations.

3. **Simulation Capabilities**:
   - Post-processing and control of computed device states through the **ngspice control interface**.

4. **Modeling Sources and Dependencies**:
   - Uses physical models from tools like **PISCES** and earlier works (CODECS).
   - References for advanced models include:
     - Inversion-layer mobility model ([LGATE90]).
     - Temperature-dependent PISCES models ([SOLL90]).
   - Does not provide full details of semiconductor equations but references foundational texts like [PINT90] and [SELB84].

5. **Advanced Modeling Access**:
   - Allows **flexible input formats** with increased access to physical model parameters.
   - New models support modern technology variations for higher simulation fidelity.

6. **Supplementary Tools**:
   - Integration with the **GSS TCAD software** (no longer maintained).
   - Successor: **Cogenda Genius**, available as open-source TCAD software.

7. **Linux Users Note**:
   - Interaction with TCAD software such as **GSS** and its evolution (Genius simulator) is available.

8. **Key Limitations**:
   - The manual does not detail the semiconductor equations or their physical model implementations.
