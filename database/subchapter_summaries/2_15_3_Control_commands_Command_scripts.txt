**Summary for Netlist Code Generation/Modification/Debugging and Components/Model/Command Queries:**

1. **Control Command Scripts Structure:**
   - Command scripts are enclosed within `.control` and `.endc` lines.
   - They can work with simulation output vectors (such as node voltages, branch currents), as well as user-defined vectors and variables.
   - Scripts allow post-simulation manipulation using expressions (syntax details in Chapt. 13.2).

2. **Parameter Usage in Scripts:**
   - Parameters defined in `.param` statements (Chapt. 2.10.1) **cannot** be used directly in expressions within `.control` scripts.
   - Use `.csparam` (Chapt. 2.12) for parameter definitions within control scripts.
   - Alternative: Define a voltage source with the parameter value. After running a transient simulation, use its output as a vector.

3. **Restrictions & Notes:**
   - Feedback from control script-extracted values back into `.param` parameters is **not possible**.
   - Non-linear sources from previous simulations cannot be accessed within a control script.
   - You **can** run an initial simulation within the control script, evaluate its output, and adjust element or model parameters using `alter` and `altermod` commands (Chapt. 13.5.3) before starting a new simulation.

4. **Scripting Commands for Parameter Adjustment:**
   - `alter`: Used to modify element parameters.
   - `altermod`: Used to modify model parameters.

5. **Expression Syntax:**
   - Expressions within `.control` scripts follow a different syntax than parameters (`.param`) or B sources (`2.10.1` and Chapt. 5.1). Reference Chapt. 13.2 for exact syntax.

6. **Examples (Chapt. 17):**
   - For further examples of expressions and command script usage, see Chapt. 17 (examples will be regularly updated).

This condensed summary ensures critical syntax, theoretical characteristics, and functionality insights for debugging, modifying, or generating netlist codes.
