Ngspice MOS Models via OpenVAF/OSDI (Section 7.6.7):

Ngspice integrates an OSDI interface and the OpenVAF compiler, enabling Verilog-A compact MOS models. Visit the [VA-Models GitHub repository](https://github.com/) for sources. Key models include:

**1) PSP Model (7.6.7.1):**  
- Purpose: Compact MOSFET model for digital, analog, and RF design.  
- Developer: NXP Semiconductors Research, universities, and CEA-Leti.  
- Characteristics:
  - Based on surface potential.
  - Models key deep-submicron CMOS effects:
    - Mobility reduction, velocity saturation, DIBL, gate current.
    - Lateral doping gradients, STI stress.
  - Integrated JUNCAP2 source/drain junction model.  
- Documentation: Available on the [CEA-Leti website](https://www.leti-cea.com).

**2) BSIM-BULK Model (7.6.7.2):**  
- Successor to BSIM4 with enhanced accuracy across all operational regions.  
- Features symmetry for analog and RF applications.

**3) BSIM-CMG Model (7.6.7.3):**  
- Purpose: Compact model for multi-gate FETs (e.g., FinFETs, Nanowire, Gate-All-Around transistors).  

**4) EKV3 Model (7.6.7.4):**  
- Characteristics:
  - Charge-based compact model suitable for CMOS scaling.
  - Adapts to planar bulk, double-gate, and FinFET technologies.
  - Designed for high-frequency, analog, and RF IC applications.
