**Summary of DC Analysis (`.DC`, `.TF`, `.OP`) in Ngspice:**

- **Purpose**: Determines the DC operating point of the circuit by treating inductors as shorted and capacitors as open. Time-dependent behavior of sources is not considered.

- **Key Syntaxes**:  
  - **`.DC`**: Used for generating DC transfer curves by sweeping a specified voltage/current source, resistor, or temperature over a user-defined range.
  - **`.TF`**: Computes the DC small-signal transfer function (ratio of output variable to input source), input, and output resistances.
  - **`.OP`**: Determines and outputs the complete DC operating point of the circuit.

- **Default Behavior**:  
  - DC analysis is performed **automatically** before:  
    - Transient analysis (to determine initial conditions).  
    - AC small-signal analysis (to compute linearized small-signal models for nonlinear devices).

- **Additional Features**:  
  - Interface between analog and event-driven parts of the circuit are iterated for system consistency.  
  - Results of the analysis can be displayed or printed as requested.  
  - Includes stepping through parameter values (voltage/current source, resistance, or temperature) to store sequential outputs as DC transfer curves.
