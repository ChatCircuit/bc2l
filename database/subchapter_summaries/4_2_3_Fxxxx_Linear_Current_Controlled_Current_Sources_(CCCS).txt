**Ngspice Manual Summary: Linear Current-Controlled Current Sources (CCCS)**  

**General Form**:  
`FXXXXXXX N+ N- VNAM VALUE <m=val>`  

**Details**:  
- `N+`, `N-`: Positive and negative nodes of the current source. Current flows from `N+` through the source to `N-`.  
- `VNAM`: Name of the voltage source controlling the current. The controlling current flows from the positive node, through the voltage source, to the negative node of `VNAM`.  
- `VALUE`: Current gain of the CCCS.  
- `m`: Optional multiplier for the output current (default is `1`).  

**Examples**:  
`F1 13 5 VSENS 5 m=2`  

Explanation:  
- Defines a CCCS from node `13` to node `5`, controlled by the current through the voltage source `VSENS`, with a current gain of `5` and an additional multiplier `m=2`.
