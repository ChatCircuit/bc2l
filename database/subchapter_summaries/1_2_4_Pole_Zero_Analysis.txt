**Summary of Pole-Zero Analysis (Ngspice Manual):**

- **Purpose:** Computes poles and/or zeros in the small-signal AC transfer function.

- **Process:**
  1. Determines DC operating point.
  2. Creates linearized, small-signal models for nonlinear devices.
  3. Uses small-signal circuit models to find poles and zeros.

- **Supported Transfer Functions:**  
  - (Output voltage) / (Input voltage)  
  - (Output voltage) / (Input current)  

  These cover cases such as input/output impedance and voltage gain.

- **Input/Output Ports Specification:** Two pairs of nodes.

- **Supported Components:** Resistors, capacitors, inductors, linear-controlled sources, independent sources, BJTs, MOSFETs, JFETs, diodes.  
  **Not Supported:** Transmission lines.

- **Numerical Method:** Sub-optimal numerical search.  
  - May be computationally expensive for large circuits.  
  - May fail or find excessive poles/zeros in certain cases.
