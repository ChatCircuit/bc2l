- **Ngspice OpenVAF/OSDI Diode Models**  
  Ngspice integrates the OSDI interface with the OpenVAF compiler, enabling the use of Verilog-A compact diode models. Two diode models supported are:

  - **JUNCAP2**  
    - Developed by Philips Research.  
    - Widely used in integrated circuit design.  
    - Works with MOS models like PSP and as an alternative diode model for source/drain junctions in BSIM4 models.  

  - **DIODE_CMC**  
    Enhancements over JUNCAP2:  
    - Series resistance.  
    - Diffusion capacitance with soft recovery.  
    - Breakdown voltage temperature coefficient.  
    - Noise modeling.  
    - Min-max parameters for generating warnings.  

Refer to Chapter 9 of the manual for details on the OpenVAF/OSDI interface.
