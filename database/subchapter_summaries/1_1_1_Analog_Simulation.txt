- **Focus of Analog Simulation**:  
  Simulates the linear and non-linear behavior of a circuit over continuous time or frequency intervals. Circuit response is solved iteratively using Kirchhoff's Laws. Slower compared to digital simulators due to matrix solving at each time step.

- **Source Types in Ngspice**:
  - **Supported sources**: DC, sine-wave, and pulse.

- **Modes of Analysis**:  
  1. **DC Analysis**:
     - Characteristics: Neglects time-varying behaviors of reactive elements.
     - Default behavior: Calculates the circuit's DC solution.  
     - Swept DC Analysis: Repeats DC analysis across a range of input source DC levels.

  2. **AC Analysis**:
     - Characteristics: Small-signal sinusoidal inputs analyzed over a frequency range.  
     - Output: Amplitudes and phases as a function of frequency.

  3. **Transient Analysis**:  
     - Characteristics: Calculates circuit response (including reactive elements) over time.
