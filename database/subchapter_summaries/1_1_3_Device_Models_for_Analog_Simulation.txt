**Summary of Device Models for Analog Simulation (Ngspice Manual)**

1. **Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) Models**:
   - **Basic Model (BJT)**: Based on the integral-charge model of Gummel and Poon; defaults to the simpler Ebers-Moll model if parameters are unspecified. Includes charge storage effects, ohmic resistances, and current-dependent output conductance.
   - **Enhanced Models**:
     - **BJT2**: Adds DC current computation for substrate diode.
     - **VBIC**: Advanced features for modern bipolar devices.

2. **Semiconductor Diode Models**:
   - Supports junction diodes and Schottky barrier diodes.

3. **JFET Models**:
   - **JFET (Shichman-Hodges Model)**.
   - **JFET2 (Parker-Skellern Model)**.

4. **MOSFET Models**:
   - **Original Six Models**:
     - **MOS1**: Square-law I-V characteristic.
     - **MOS2**: Analytical model.
     - **MOS3**: Semi-empirical model.
     - **MOS6**: Simplified analytic model for short-channel accuracy.
     - **MOS9**: Modified Level 3 model (distinct from Philips Level 9).
     - **BSIM1/BSIM2**: Early Berkeley Short-Channel IGFET Models.
   - **Features of MOS2, MOS3, BSIM**: Support second-order effects such as channel-length modulation, subthreshold conduction, small-size effects, scattering-limited velocity saturation, and charge-controlled capacitance.
   - **Recent Models**:
     - **BSIM3/BSIM4**: Developed for submicron devices.
     - **SOI Models**: Silicon-on-insulator modeled via BSIMSOI family and STAG models.

5. **HFET Models**:
   - Partial support for HFET and MESA device modeling.

6. **Verilog-A Models**:
   - Available through OpenVAF/OSDI interface.

**Important Notes for Netlist Coding/Debugging**:
- When using any transistor models (e.g., BJT, MOSFET), ensure model-specific parameters are properly defined, as default behavior will simplify to basic versions.
- For MOSFET netlists, second-order effects in MOS2 and MOS3 can play a crucial role in accurate simulations for short-channel and subthreshold operations.
