**Summary for Netlist Code Generation/Modification/Debugging**:

**6.1 Lossless Transmission Lines**

**General Form** (Netlist Syntax):
```
TXXXXXXX N1 N2 N3 N4 Z0=VALUE <TD=VALUE> <F=FREQ <NL=NRMLEN>> <IC=V1, I1, V2, I2>
```

**Parameter Descriptions**:
- **N1, N2**: Nodes at port 1.
- **N3, N4**: Nodes at port 2.
- **Z0**: Characteristic impedance (mandatory).
- **TD=VALUE**: Transmission delay (optional, directly specified).
- **F=FREQ**: Frequency (optional, used for normalized length calculation).
- **NL=NRMLEN**: Normalized electrical length (optional, defaults to 0.25 if omitted when frequency is specified).

**Important Characteristics**:
- **Transmission Delay Calculation** (if `F` and `NL` are used):  
  `TD = NL/F`.
- If neither `TD` nor (`F` and `NL`) is specified, the transmission line cannot be modeled.
- No `.model` line is required for lossless transmission lines.
  
**Initial Conditions (IC)**:
- Syntax: `IC=V1, I1, V2, I2`.
- Specifies initial voltage and current at each port.
- Active only when the `UIC` option is used on the `.TRAN` control line.

**Key Notes**:
- Models only one propagating mode; for circuits with four distinct nodes (two modes), two transmission-line elements are required.
- Lossless transmission lines’ implementation may exhibit less accuracy compared to a lossy transmission line model with zero loss.

**Example Code**:
```
T1 1 0 2 0 Z0=50 TD=10NS
```
- Defines a transmission line with characteristic impedance of 50Ω and delay of 10ns.
