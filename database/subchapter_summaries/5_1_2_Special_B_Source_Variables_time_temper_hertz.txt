**Ngspice Manual 5.1.2: Special B-Source Variables**  
Important Variables:  
1. **time**:  
   - Represents actual simulation time during transient analysis.  
   - Equals zero in AC analysis.  

2. **temper**:  
   - Reflects the circuit temperature (Â°C) during transient analysis.  

3. **hertz**:  
   - Used in AC analysis, represents frequency.  
   - Equals zero during transient analysis.  
   - Computational Cost: May increase CPU time for large circuits, as the operating point must be determined for each frequency before AC response computation.
