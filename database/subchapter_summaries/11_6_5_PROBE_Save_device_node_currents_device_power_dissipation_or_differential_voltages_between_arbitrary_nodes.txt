**11.6.5 .PROBE: Overview**  
The `.probe` command in Ngspice is used to measure device node currents, power dissipation, or differential voltages in circuits.

**1. Current Measurement (.probe alli / .probe I):**  
- **Mechanism:** It uses a zero-volt voltage source (VSRC) to measure currents at device nodes, saved as `xx#branch` format (e.g., `R1#branch`).  
- **Scope:** Only top-level devices are accessible (not subcircuits). Named nodes in subcircuits can be measured if subcircuit definitions provide names.  
- **Impact:** May add new nodes to the instance matrix, slightly increasing simulation time.  

**General Syntax:**  
- `.probe alli` → Measure current at every device node.  
- `.probe I(device)` → Measure current at all terminals of a device.  
- `.probe I(device,node)` → Measure current at a single terminal of a device.  

**Examples:**  
- `.probe alli` → All nodes in the circuit.  
- `.probe I(R1)` → Node 1 of two-terminal device `R1`.  
- `.probe I(XU1)` → All nodes in subcircuit `XU1`.  
- `.probe I(MQ4,3)` → Node 3 of multi-terminal device `MQ4`.  

**Resulting Vectors:**  
- Example entries: `r1#branch`, `xu1:gnd#branch`, `xu1:out#branch`, etc.

**2. Differential Voltage Measurement (.probe vd):**  
- **Mechanism:** Uses a Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) with gain = 1 to measure voltages between nodes. Output vector names use a `vd_` prefix.  
- **Types of Measurements:** Across nodes of devices (single device) or between nodes of different devices.  

**General Syntax:**  
- `.probe v(node1)` → Voltage at `node1`.  
- `.probe vd(device:node1:node2)` → Voltage across nodes of a device.  
- `.probe vd(device1:node1, device2:node2)` → Voltage between nodes of two devices.  

**Examples:**  
- `.probe v(nR1)` → Voltage at node `nR1`.  
- `.probe vd(R1)` → Voltage across `R1`.  
- `.probe vd(m4:1:3)` → Between nodes `1` and `3` of `m4`.  
- `.probe vd(m4:d, m5:s)` → MOS device, `d` terminal of `m4` and `s` terminal of `m5`.  

**Resulting Vectors:**  
- Example entries: `vd_R1`, `vd_m4:d:0`, `vd_m4:d:s`.

**3. Power Dissipation Measurement (.probe p):**  
- **Mechanism:** Node currents (`i1, i2...`) and voltages (`v1, v2...`) are measured. A virtual reference voltage `vref` is calculated as the mean of all node voltages. Power is calculated as:  
  `P = i1*(v1-vref) + i2*(v2-vref) + ... + in*(vn-vref)`  

**General Syntax:**  
- `.probe p(device)` → Power dissipation in a device.  

**Examples:**  
- `.probe p(XU1)` → Subcircuit `XU1`.  
- `.probe p(MQ1)` → MOS transistor `MQ1`.  

**Resulting Vectors:**  
- Example entries: `xu1:power`, `mq1:power`.

**Remarks:**  
- Unlike `.options savecurrents`, `.probe` vectors are available for all simulation types (e.g., AC simulation).  
- If `.save` is absent, only the `.probe` vectors are saved.
