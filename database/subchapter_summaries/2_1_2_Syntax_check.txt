2.1.2 Syntax Check  
- Preliminary syntax checks are implemented in the input parser.

2.1.2.1 Valid UTF-8 Characters  
- The input file is scanned for valid UTF-8 characters. If invalid characters are present, input reading stops.

2.1.2.2 Special Characters Leading a Line  
- If the first character in a netlist or `.control` line is one of `=[]?()&%$ยง\"!:`, it is replaced by `*`, and a warning is issued.  
- The command `set strict_errorhandling` will force ngspice to exit when such special characters are detected.

2.1.2.3 Dot Command Couple Completion  
- Ensures the proper pairing of the following constructs:  
  - `.control ... .endc`  
  - `.subckt ... .ends`  
  - `.if ... .endif`
