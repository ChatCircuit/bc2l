4.1.11 RF Port  
- A voltage source (VSRC) can function as an RF Port using specific parameters.  

**Key Parameters:**  
1. **portnum (integer):**  
   - Mandatory to define the VSRC as an RF port.  
   - Must start from 1 and increment consecutively without duplicates.  

2. **Z0 (real):**  
   - Specifies the internal impedance of the RF Port.  
   - Default value: **50 Ohms** if not explicitly defined.  

**Behavior:**  
- When defined as an RF Port, the VSRC has an impedance of Z0 Ohms in series, affecting all simulations.  
- At least two RF Ports are required for S-parameter simulations (using `.sp`).  

**General Syntax:**  
`DC 0 AC 1 portnum n1 <z0 n2>`  

**Example:**  
`V1 in 0 dc 0 ac 1 portnum 1 z0 100`  
- Declares an RF Port with a port number of 1 and an internal impedance of 100 Ohms.  

**Note:**  
- If `portnum` is **not provided**, the VSRC behaves as a standard voltage source.
