**Summary of 5.3 Gxxxx: Non-linear Current Source**

Component: Non-linear Current Source  
- Syntax: `Gxxxx n+ n– nc+ nc– poly(N) C0 C1 … CN <expression>`  
  - `n+ n–`: Current source terminals.  
  - `nc+ nc–`: Controlling voltage source terminals.  
  - `poly(N)`: Specifies a polynomial current source of degree N.  
  - `C0 C1 … CN`: Coefficients of the polynomial.  
  - `<expression>`: Optional expression for defining complex non-linear dependencies of current.  

Default Characteristics:  
- If `poly(N)` and coefficients are used, the current is computed as a polynomial function of the controlling voltage.  

Additional Notes:  
- For advanced applications, `<expression>` can include any valid mathematical operation supported by Ngspice for defining non-linear behavior.
