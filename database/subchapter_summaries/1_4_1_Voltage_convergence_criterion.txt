**Summary:**

**Voltage Convergence Criterion:**
1. Convergence occurs when the voltage difference between the last iteration (k) and the current iteration (k+1) satisfies:
   - |vn(k+1) - vn(k)| ≤ RELTOL * vmax + VNTOL  
     where:
     - **vmax** = max(|vn(k+1)|, |vn(k)|).

2. Parameters:
   - **RELTOL (relative tolerance) Default value: 1e-3**  
     Specifies how small the relative solution update must be for convergence based on the node voltage.
   - **VNTOL (absolute tolerance) Default value: 1μV**  
     Handles near-zero node voltages that RELTOL cannot effectively address due to computational round-off limits.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **RELTOL** ensures proportional tolerance relative to node voltage values.
- **VNTOL** provides an absolute threshold for convergence irrespective of relative tolerance, critical for nodes with near-zero voltages.
