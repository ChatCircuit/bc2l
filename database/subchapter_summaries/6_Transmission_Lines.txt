6 Transmission Lines  
Ngspice supports two transmission line models:  
1. **SPICE3f5 Transmission Line Model**  
2. **KSPICE Model**  
   - KSPICE provides improved transient analysis for lossy transmission lines and coupled multiconductor systems via the **recursive convolution method**.   
   - Uses Pade approximations to derive recursive convolutions for impulse response computation.  
   - Offers a performance speedup of 10x to 100x compared to SPICE3f5 for simulating:  
     - Lossy transmission lines.  
     - Multiconductor line systems using modal functions.
