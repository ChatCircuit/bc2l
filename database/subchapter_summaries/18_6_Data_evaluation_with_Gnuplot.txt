The extracted important information related to netlist code generation, modification, debugging, and analysis is:

- **Command to Plot with Gnuplot in Ngspice:**
  `gnuplot pl4mag v4mag xlimit 500 1500`
  - Generates a plot with specified x-axis limits (500 to 1500).

- **Loading a Gnuplot Command File:**
  `load 'pl-v4mag.p'`
  - Executes a Gnuplot script to analyze simulation data.

- **Gaussian Curve Fitting in Gnuplot:**
  - Gaussian Function for Fitting:
    ```
    f1(x) = (c1 / (a1 * sqrt(2 * 3.14159)) * exp(-((x - b1)**2) / (2 * a1**2)))
    ```
  - Gaussian Function to Plot Initial Graph:
    ```
    f2(x) = (c2 / (a2 * sqrt(2 * 3.14159)) * exp(-((x - b2)**2) / (2 * a2**2)))
    ```
  - Starting Values:
    ```
    a1 = 50; b1 = 900; c1 = 50
    a2 = a1; b2 = b1; c2 = c1
    ```
  - Curve Fitting Command:
    `fit f1(x) 'pl4mag.data' using 1:2 via a1, b1, c1`

- **Plot Original and Fitted Curves:**
  ```
  plot "pl4mag.data" using 1:2 with lines, f1(x), f2(x)
  ```
  - `"pl4mag.data"`: Simulation data.
  - `f1(x)`: Fitted Gaussian curve.
  - `f2(x)`: Initial Gaussian curve.

- **Key Notes:**
  - The mean oscillator frequency and its deviation are derived from curve fitting in Gnuplot.
  - This serves as an example; Gnuplot can be employed for more advanced statistical analyses.
