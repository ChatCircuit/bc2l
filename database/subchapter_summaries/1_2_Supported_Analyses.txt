**Ngspice Supported Analyses Summary:**

Ngspice supports various types of simulation analyses, which are invoked using specific netlist directives. Below is the list of supported analyses and relevant details:

1. **DC Analysis (Operating Point and DC Sweep)**:  
   - **Directives**: `.DC` and `.OP`.
   - Used for determining circuit behavior under static conditions or varying DC sources.
   - Analog-only applications supported.

2. **AC Small-Signal Analysis**:  
   - **Directive**: `.AC`.
   - Analyzes frequency response of a circuit.
   - Applies to analog circuits.

3. **Transient Analysis**:  
   - **Directive**: `.TRAN`.
   - Simulates circuit behavior over time.
   - Supported for both analog and event-driven applications including digital components.

4. **Pole-Zero Analysis**:  
   - **Directive**: `.PZ`.
   - Used for calculating poles and zeros of circuits (not supported for digital applications).
   - Analog-only applications supported.

5. **Small-Signal Distortion Analysis**:  
   - **Directive**: `.DISTO`.
   - Evaluates distortion effects in an analog circuit.
   - Exclusively for analog applications.

6. **Sensitivity Analysis**:  
   - **Directive**: `.SENS`.
   - Calculates sensitivity of circuit response to parameter variation.
   - Applicable for analog circuits only.

7. **Noise Analysis**:  
   - **Directive**: `.NOISE`.
   - Predicts noise contribution from components.
   - Limited to analog circuits.

- **Application Restrictions**:  
  - Analog applications can utilize all analysis modes except those restricted by the Code Model subsystem (Pole-Zero, Distortion, Sensitivity, Noise unsupported).
  - Event-driven applications (digital and user-defined types) are limited to **DC** and **Transient analyses**.

Understanding relationships between analyses and simulation algorithms is crucial. Specific netlist directives govern these modes and should be used appropriately depending on circuit type (analog or digital).
