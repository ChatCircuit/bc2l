**Summary of Section 11.1.3 AC Solution Options:**

- **NOOPAC**:  
  - Skips the operating point (OP) analysis prior to AC analysis.  
  - Applicable only to linear circuits comprising R, L, C devices, independent voltage/current sources, and linear dependent sources (E, G, H, F) without "poly" or non-behavioral definitions.  
  - If any non-linear device is detected, OP analysis executes automatically.  
  - Useful for circuits like nested LC networks without series resistance in inductors (L).  
  - Beneficial for very large linear networks (e.g., 10,000+ nodes), potentially increasing simulation speed by up to 10Ã—.  
  - Avoids matrix ill-formation issues encountered during OP analysis.
