**Summary for Netlist Code and Debugging in Ngspice:**

1. **Current Convergence Criterion**:
   - Ngspice ensures convergence on non-linear branches by evaluating the difference between:
     a. The current computed for the last voltage iteration.
     b. The linear approximation of the same current computed using the actual voltage.

   - Criterion formula:
     | \(i_{\text{branch}}^{k+1} - i_{\text{branch}}^k\) | ≤ RELTOL × \(i_{\text{branch},\text{max}}\) + ABSTOL

     Where:
     - \(i_{\text{branch},\text{max}}\) = max(\(i_{\text{branch}}^{k+1}\), \(i_{\text{branch}}^k\)).
     - \(i_{\text{branch}}^{k+1}\): Linear approximation of the current.
     - RELTOL and ABSTOL are user-defined tolerances. 

This information is useful for debugging convergence issues in non-linear components within a netlist. For precise control, ensure RELTOL and ABSTOL values are appropriately set in simulation commands.
