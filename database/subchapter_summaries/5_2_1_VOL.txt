**Summary for Netlist Code Generation/Modification/Debugging:**

**Component: VOL (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source)**  
**General Syntax:**  
`EXXXXXXX n+ n- vol='expr'`  
- **n+:** Positive node connection  
- **n-:** Negative node connection  
- **vol='expr':** Expression defining the output voltage  

**Expression Details:**  
- The `expr` can include:  
  - Node voltages (e.g., `V(node)`), branch currents (e.g., `i(vm)`), parameters, and special variables (`time`, `temper`, `hertz`).  
  - Mathematical equations similar to expressions for the B source (see Chapter 5.1 for reference).  

**Allowed Symbols:**  
- The expression can be enclosed using:
  - Single quotes (`'expr'`)  
  - Curly braces (`{expr}`)  

**Default Characteristics:**  
- Output voltage is evaluated based on the given expression, dynamically influenced by circuit parameters, voltages, currents, and special variables.

**Example Code:**  
`E41 4 0 vol = 'V(3)*V(3)-Offs'`  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Defines a voltage source between nodes 4 and 0.  
  - Voltage output is calculated as `(V(3) * V(3)) - Offs`.  

This extracted information provides insights for creating or debugging netlists involving controlled voltage sources (`VOL`).
