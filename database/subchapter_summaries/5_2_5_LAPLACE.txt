5.2.5 LAPLACE  
Ngspice does not provide a direct E-Source element with the LAPLACE option. Instead, the XSPICE model `s_xfer` is used for implementing Laplace transforms. XSPICE must be enabled, and Laplace transformations are compatible with AC and transient analyses.

### Conversion of E-Source with Laplace Transform to `s_xfer`
#### Original Example (Using E-Source):
```
ELOPASS 4 0 LAPLACE {V(1)}
+                   {5 * (s/100 + 1) / (s^2/42000 + s/60 + 1)}
```

#### Replacement Using `s_xfer`:
```
AELOPASS 1 int_4 filter1
.model filter1 s_xfer(gain=5
+                    num_coeff=[{1/100} 1]
+                    den_coeff=[{1/42000} {1/60} 1]
+                    int_ic=[0 0])
ELOPASS 4 0 int_4 0 1
```

- `int_4`: Intermediate output node.
- The voltage on node `1` is the input, passed through the filter model `s_xfer` and buffered to `ELOPASS` for further processing.
- Use an E-Source as a buffer to retain the original name (`ELOPASS`), if required for subsequent references.

### E-Source with Complex Controlling Expression
For cases with more complex controlling expressions (beyond a simple voltage), use a B-Source for preprocessing before feeding into the A-device.

#### Original Example (Complex Control):
```
ELOPASS 4 0 LAPLACE {V(1)*v(2)} {10 / (s/6800 + 1)}
```

#### Replacement:
```
BELOPASS int_1 0 V=V(1)*v(2)
AELOPASS int_1 int_4 filter1
.model filter1 s_xfer(gain=10
+                    num_coeff=[1]
+                    den_coeff=[{1/6800} 1]
+                    int_ic=[0])
ELOPASS 4 0 int_4 0 1
```

### Key Points:
1. Use `s_xfer` for Laplace-related operations.
2. Explicitly define `num_coeff` (numerator coefficients) and `den_coeff` (denominator coefficients) for the Laplace transform.
3. Use initial conditions `int_ic` as needed.
4. For complex expressions, preprocess using B-Sources and feed output into `s_xfer`.
5. Buffer the output using E-Source if the original element name needs to be preserved.
