**Summary for 5.2.3 TABLE Component in Ngspice**

1. **Purpose**:  
   The TABLE function in Ngspice generates a corresponding y-value based on an x-value (provided by an expression), using a tabulated set of (x, y) pairs. Linear interpolation is applied between the tabulated points, with results clipped to the y-value boundaries if x is outside the table range (limiting function).

2. **Key Characteristics**:  
   - Data is entered as `(x, y)` pairs.
   - `Expression`: May contain node voltages, branch currents (e.g., `i(vm)`), or other terms described under the B-source. Parameters are not allowed in the value pairs.
   - Function delimiters: `'{ }'` or `' '` may delimit the expression.  
   - Behavior outside range:
     - If `x-value < x0`, returns `y0`.
     - If `x-value > x2`, returns `y2`.

3. **Syntax**:  
   ```
   Exxx n1 n2 TABLE {expression} = (x0, y0) (x1, y1) (x2, y2)
   ```

4. **Example (Simple Comparator)**:  
   ```
   ECMP 11 0 TABLE {V(10,9)} = (-5mV, 0V) (5mV, 5V)
   ```
   - Here, if the differential voltage `V(10,9)` lies between `-5mV` and `5mV`, linear interpolation is used. For values outside the range, it clips to `0V` or `5V`.
