Ngspice since version 42 provides two matrix solvers:

1. **Sparse 1.3** (default solver from Spice3f5):
   - Robust for all simulation tasks, especially suited for simulating behavioral models.

2. **KLU matrix solver** (optional):
   - Designed to speed up the simulation of large circuits with thousands of transistors.  
   - Can be selected for improved performance in such cases (refer to chapter 11.1.1 in the manual for selection details).
