End-of-line Comments in Ngspice:

General Syntax (for adding comments):
- `<any command> $ <any comment>`  
- `<any command> ; <any comment>`  
- `<any command> // <any comment>`

Examples:
- `RF2=1K $ Gain should be 100`
- `C1=10p ; Check open-loop gain and phase margin`
- `.param n1=1 // new value`

Notes:
1. Comments can use `$`, `;`, or `//`. For readability, precede these characters with a space.
2. When PSPICE compatibility mode is enabled, `$` is treated as a regular character and no longer acts as a comment delimiter.
