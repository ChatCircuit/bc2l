**Small-Signal Distortion Analysis (Ngspice 1.2.5)**  

- **Purpose:** Computes steady-state harmonic and intermodulation products for small input signal magnitudes.  
- **Input Signals:**
  - Single frequency: Complex values of second and third harmonics are calculated at every circuit point.
  - Two frequencies: Computes:
    - Sum and difference of input frequencies.
    - Difference of the smaller frequency from the second harmonic of the larger frequency.  

- **Supported Nonlinear Devices for Distortion Analysis:**
  - **Diodes:** DIO
  - **BJTs**
  - **JFET:** Level 1
  - **MOSFETs:** Levels 1, 2, 3, 9, BSIM1
  - **MESFET:** Level 1  

- **Other Device Behavior:**
  - All linear devices are automatically supported.
  - Switches are supported **only if they do not change state** under small excitation.  

- **For Unsupported Models:** Use Fourier or FFT statements and process output manually.
