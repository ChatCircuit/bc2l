The section **2.1 General Structure and Conventions** covers the syntax and conventions used in Ngspice. Here's the summary:

- **General Structure of Netlist**:
  1. Each line represents a statement.
  2. Case-insensitive.
  3. Comments start with an asterisk (`*`) or `$`.
  4. Continuation of a line uses a `+` at the start of the next line.

- **Component Definition**:
  * Components must start with a specific character:
    - `R`, `L`, `C` for passive components (resistor, inductor, and capacitor).
    - `V`, `I` for independent voltage and current sources.
    - `D` for diodes, `Q` for BJTs, `M` for MOSFETs, etc.

- **Node Naming**:
  * Nodes are identified numerically (e.g., 1, 2) or with alphanumeric labels.
  * Node `0` is always the global ground.

- **Units**:
  * Default units include:
    - Resistance: ohms.
    - Capacitance: farads.
    - Inductance: henries.
  
- **Model and Subcircuit References**:
  * Models are defined with the `.MODEL` keyword.
  * Subcircuits are defined using `.SUBCKT` and `.ENDS`.
  
- **Simulation Commands**:
  * Simulation setup and execution use commands like `.DC`, `.AC`, `.TRAN`, etc.

This section provides a foundational understanding for writing Ngspice netlists, ensuring consistency and correct syntax usage in simulation workflows.
