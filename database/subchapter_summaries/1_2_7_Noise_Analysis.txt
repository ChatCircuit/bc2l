**Noise Analysis (Ngspice)**

- **Purpose**: Measures device-generated noise in a circuit by calculating the noise contributions at the output port and equivalent input noise.

- **Key Processes**:
  - Calculates noise spectral densities for each frequency point in a specified range.
  - Spectral density corresponds to the circuit variable as a stationary Gaussian stochastic process.
  - Integrates spectral densities over the frequency range to compute total noise voltage and current.

- **Theoretical Characteristics**:
  - Calculated total noise values represent the variance of circuit variables modeled as stationary Gaussian processes.

- **Inputs Required**:
  - An input source for analysis.
  - An output port for noise measurement.
