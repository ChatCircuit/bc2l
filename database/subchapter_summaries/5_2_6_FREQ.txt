- **FREQ Option in Ngspice**:  
  Ngspice does not provide a direct E-Source element with the `FREQ` option but supports its implementation through the XSPICE code model `xfer`. XSPICE must be enabled. Only AC analysis is supported.

- **Example E-Source Syntax**:  
  ```
  EXFER 1 0 FREQ {V(20,21)} = DB
  +(1.000000e+07Hz,  1.633257e-07, -1.859873e+01)
  +(1.025641e+08Hz, -4.165672e+00, -4.076855e+02)
  +(2.000000e+08Hz, -2.798303e-05, -7.519027e+02)
  ```
  - **Explanation**:  
    - Produces a complex voltage by multiplying the input differential voltage `V(20, 21)` with a PWL transfer function of simulation frequency.  
    - The `DB` keyword specifies:  
      - Second column: Gain in decibels (dB).  
      - Third column: Phase in degrees.  
    - Alternatives:  
      - `MAG`: Linear gain.  
      - `RAD`: Phase in radians.  
      - `DEG` (default): Phase in degrees.  
      - `R_I`: Real and imaginary parts.  

- **Summary Notes**:  
  - This capability is achieved via netlist rewriting with XSPICE and is limited to AC analysis.
