#### HOW TO RUN NGSPICE FROM CMD
###############################
ref: ngspice43 manual ch17 from page 501

ngspice_con circuit_netlist_file.cir

After a few moments, you should see the ngspice prompt:
ngspice 1 -> 

To see the circuit description read by the simulator you can issue the following command:
ngspice 1 -> listing

Now, execute the simulation by entering the run command:
ngspice 1 -> run


To examine the results of this transient analysis, we can use the plot command. First we will
plot the nodes labeled ‘1’ and ‘base’.
ngspice 2 -> plot v(1) base

Now, issue the following command to examine the voltages on two of the internal nodes of the
transistor amplifier circuit:
ngspice 3 -> plot vcc coll emit


To run the DC simulation of the transistor amplifier, issue the following command:
ngspice 4 -> op

After a moment the ngspice prompt returns. Now issue the print command to examine the
emitter, base, and collector DC bias voltages.
ngspice 5 -> print emit base coll

To run an AC analysis, enter the following command:
ngspice 6 -> ac dec 10 0.01 100

ssue to the following command to plot the response curve at node ‘coll’:
ngspice 7 -> plot coll

ngspice 8 -> plot db(coll) ph(coll)

ngspice 9 -> dc vcc 0 15 0.1

ngspice 10 -> plot emit base coll

ngspice 11 -> quit


###### running the gui ngspice
open the application then: source <netlistfilelocation.cir>

###### NGSPICE NETLIST FORMAT
######################################

	* use the control statement to give instruction to ngspice. this is not the circuit netlist. this is instruction to ngspice.

.control 
..
..
.endc



	* to plot from cmd using ngspice_con and gnuplot use:

gnuplot gp v(node_name)

gnuplot must be installed in pc.

####### MISC. NOTES
####################################

	* using capacitor like c1 1 0 1uF and then doing transient analysis wont bring up the curve, it will be flat, as there is no initial condition set.
do it like this: 
c1 2 0 1u ic=0
.tran 0.02ms 20ms uic
