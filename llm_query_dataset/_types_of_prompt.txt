	* general query
Queries that do not require any type of code generation or code modification. for example: what are you?, what is a transient analysis? etc. general query can be answered from the prompt context (may come in context from RAG) and LLM inherent knowledge.

	* netlist modification query
queries that require modification of some lines of the netlist or add some new lines into the netlist. but this category of query does not add/modify any simulation code into the netlist, only modifies the circuit description, not the simulation description. for example: add a new resistor of 987 ohm between node 1 and 5. 
may require handling components with specific model number from model library. example: in place of the simple diode shown in the netlist, use the 1N4001G diode.

	* simple simulation command query 
queries that require only adding simulation spice code at the end of the netlist. example: what is the voltage at node 3, 4 and 10?

	* compound simulation command query
queries that require modifying the ckt netlist/simulation commands and then perform some simulation. example: change resistance R1 to 600 ohm and find the voltage across it. so it is basically netlist modification query + simple simulation command query. example: find current through resistor R6 (this requires adding a voltage source in series with the resistor[netlist modification] and then observe the current through the voltage[simple simulation command])

	* complex simulation command query
queries that require both spice code modification (ckt netlist modification or sim command or both) and then needs some data analysis on the simulation output using python. example 1: find the equivalent resistance between node a and b (this requires stripping off the circuit outside node a,b. then adding a voltage source between node a, b. then measure the current through the voltage source. then equivalent resistance = voltage/current).

	* plot query
queries that ask to plot some data. example: do a transient analysis of the circuit and plot the voltage and current across capacitor C3.

	* data analysis query 
queries that require no spice simulation or netlist modification. it only requires data analysis using python on the existing simulation output available. example: based on the last transient analysis, find the time point when the power consumed by resistor R3 is maximum.

	* extract sub-circuit then simulate on it 
queries that require extracting a certain portion of the circuit according to the user prompt and then perform some simulation only on that subcircuit. this may be helpful in simulation of big circuits. example: in the rectifier circuit, i want to perform simulation only on the transformer part which steps down the voltage. show me the voltage output of the transformer with transient analysis.
