TYPE,QUERY,EXPECTED OUTPUT,SUCCESS,COMMENT
general,hello!,,yes,
general,what are you? ,,yes,
general,what can you do,,yes,
general,what type of simulations can you perform,,no,need RAG data
general,show your netlist,,yes,
simple sim com,do a DC steady state analysis,,yes,performed trans analysis instead of op
simple sim com,what is the voltage across the resistor,0V,yes,
simple sim com,what about for the capacitor?,5V ,yes,
compound sim com,what is the current through the capacitor?,current through the capacitor is 0 A.,yes,
compound sim com,what is current throught the resistor,current through the resistor is 0 A.,yes,
simple sim com,now do a transient analysis,,no,"did not add uic, need RAG"
general,what is the start time and end time of the analysis you did and what is time step used? ,,yes,
netlist mod,change the end time to 3ms.,,yes,
plot,plot the voltage across the capacitor,,yes,
"simple sim com, plot",what is the voltage across the resistor,should plot out the voltage or show data in tabular form,yes,
plot,can you plot the current through the capacitor?,,yes,
plot,plot the current and voltage through the resistor in the same plot ,,yes,
complex sim com,what is the energy consumed by the resistor for the first 2s? ,,yes,
simple sim com,now do a transient analysis for a time of 5*time constant of the RC circuit.,,yes,
plot,now plot the current through the capacitor and the voltage across it.,,yes,
"compound sim com, plot",change the resistor value to 2k ohm and plot the voltage through the capacitor,,yes,
,"okay, do two analysis, one with R1=1kohm and one with R1=2kohm and plot the capacitor voltage in both case.",,no,
"multiple compound sim com, multiple plot",now use R = 100 ohm and R = 500 ohm and plot the time vs voltage across the capacitor for both cases on the same graph.,,no,"can generate the code and everything properly, but as sim data out from both sim is needed at the same time, it cannot do it, because of program bug. Fix the issue in main_cli "
"multiple compound sim com, multiple plot",plot the voltage across the capacitor for the dc voltage source value in the range of 1V to 10V. increment the voltage by 2V and do a transient analysis for every value of the voltage source. show me the voltage across the cap for all the different dc source value in one same plot.,,yes,"failed on first attempt, but was okay in next attempt"
netlist mod,"okay. Now, change the dc voltage source with a AC sinusoidal voltage source with amplitude = 5V and frequency = 10Hz.",,yes,
general,show me the new netlist,,yes,
simple sim com,do a ac steady state analysis and tell me the phasor value of voltage and current for the resistor and the capacitor.,,maybe yes,
"simple sim com, plot",now  do a transient analysis and plot the current through the capacitor for the first 10ms. ,,yes,
"compound sim com, plot","no, do it for 50ms. ",,yes,
plot,what is the voltage at node 1,,yes,
plot,plot the voltage at node out,,yes,
general,That was great talking to you! You are amazing!,,yes,
